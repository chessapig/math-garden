#definition 
$(\calP,\omega)$ is a symplectic manifold, with Hamiltonian $G$-action defined by [[Moment map]] $\mu:\calP \to \mathfrak{g}^*$. The *Symplectic Quotient* (or *Marsden-Weinstein Quotient*) is
$$\calP //G \equiv \mu\inv(0)/G$$
When $0$ is a regular value of the moment map, this is a manifold with well defined symplectic form.
