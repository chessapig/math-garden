#definition
Let $(\calP,\omega)$ be a symplectic manifold, with a Hamiltonian $G$ action. The *Moment map* is a function valued in the dual of the lie algebra
$$\mu : \calP \to \mathfrak{g}^*$$

such that for $g \in \mathfrak{g}$, the hamiltonian vector field of $\mu(g)$ equals the flow generated by $g$.
